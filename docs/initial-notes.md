## Notes
This is a workout app that "gamifies" your gym progress. 

## Similar Existing Products
This will be similar to the Liftoff - Ranked Gym Workouts app. However, this will not be an iOS application right off the bat, I will build it as a web app. I would like to build this as a open-source project and deploy it on GitHub for others to use. 

## Why is it different?
What sets this application different to other ones is that this sets a gamify and a gamified feature to go into the gym. Think in terms of Counter-Strike or Call of Duty ranked or ranked Fortnite, you know, you'll have different ranks and you can rank up. 

## Ranks
Ranks can be anywhere from bronze, silver, gold, diamond, champion, elite, unreal. It doesn't have to be that exactly, but you get the gist of it. Ranks will be determined by several factors. There will be a rank given to a muscle group based on a given lift/workout in that group, and based on the given person's statistics and the workout's weight/rep count. To further explain the ranking structure or the ranking system or logic behind the ranking, an individual will put in, when creating their profile, an individual will put in their body metrics, their height, weight, age, gender, and then they'll be asked to either in a one rep max or if they don't do a one rep max, a full maximum effort working set of a particular workout in a given muscle group. And based on the level of strength required to do that and their personal metrics, they will be given a rank as to how good that lift is compared to to their body and body metrics. In addition to that initial rank that's given on that initial workout, the rank will be increased numerically. I guess we'll do numeric ranking system, but a range of numeric values will be a certain rank, such as bronze, silver, gold, etc. But in addition to that initial rank, each workout that is shown progress, depending on the progress made and how hard the workout was, a user's rank will increase. And if they don't go to the gym, the rank will decrease. So it's about keeping everybody accountable and pushing progress to be made for everybody that uses our application. 

## Logic
The logic behind this ranking system can be seen as a user can initially input their age, their height, weight, and whether or not they're a male or female. And then how long they've been lifting and some just common weights that they use on a daily basis. Maybe their one rep max is on bench press, deadlift, squat. And then kind of what they use for tricep extensions or what they're using for bicep, just a standard bicep curl set of 10 or a set of five, you know, whatever they think that would be. And then based on that, we will calculate their initial rank. And then after that, users will, this will not be a workout logging application, I don't think. Maybe, I guess we probably should. But a user will either log it in the app itself or import a, you know, import text that has been exported from another application that they use for logging. Or if they just use their notes to log their workouts or they can directly log it with us. And based on that, we will, you know, calculate and improve their rank. Each body part will have a rank. And as their weight progresses, their rank's going to go up. If they don't go to the gym for, you know, an extended period of time, their rank is going to go down for every body part. Or if they're neglecting certain body parts. Yeah. So we'll work further on the logic later. But that's going to be kind of standard where we're at with the logic initially.

## App Structure
The structure of the app is going to be a web app initially. And I will be eventually deploying this on my home server. That way it's always running on my network and I don't have to worry about it taking up resources on my main desktop computer. In terms of deploying this to GitHub, I suppose we can just forget the Docker deployment aspect and just have users be able to just clone the repository and then run npm run dev and have it running. And then if they can do that, they can figure out how to put it in a Docker container. As for the back end, we can do Node.js, Next.js, and then use TypeScript for the front end. Just a simple full stack. We can use whatever, I'm not sure, on the front end framework. We can use Vite or Tailwind. We definitely need a database, and we can use Prisma for that, I suppose, would be super simple option. It definitely needs to go ahead and have good mobile scaling and responsiveness through mobile devices. While this is primarily and initially going to be a web application, a full stack web app that'll be running on my home server, I would like to use it with my mobile device at home and with hopes of turning it into a true mobile application in the future if it bodes successful in this realm. So it needs proper responsiveness and scaling and layout for a desktop user, a tablet user and a phone user. 

## Desired Features
First of all, there needs to be a way to track users workouts. There needs to be a way for a user to upload a string of text or a big text file. Actually, I don't know if that's going to be feasible or not because we can't guarantee that the text file is going to look the same and then we have to worry about parsing that. So let's just actually have a, let's not worry about that. Let's just have users be able to manually enter in their workouts. Obviously, their workout will need kind of a day structure. So was it an arm day? Was it leg day, back day, full body, upper body, lower body? You know, we need all those, you know, whatever, whatever workout day that was for them. And then they need to be able to put in what workouts they're doing, how many sets, how many reps in those sets and for what weight. If talking about dumbbells, we need a way to make sure that we're talking about using both dumbbells. Sometimes some exercises call for one single dumbbell. So a single 30 pound dumbbell is not going to equate to the same weight moved as using two 30 pound dumbbells. So we need a way to differentiate that. And then, you know, each of those workouts need to have, you know, their respective categories and what muscle group they're targeting. 

There needs to be a profile feature, so a user must create a profile and that be tailored to them with their own stats. We need to keep track of the stats of the user, keep track. We need to ask them to input, as we said before, input their body specifications and kind of their initial... levels in the gym of where they're at. That way we can progress their ranks forward. And we'll have... We will need to compile a... Just some standardized data of, you know, what is considered a lot of weight for a person at, you know, at a certain amount of pounds at a certain amount of weight. Should the, you know, how good is a 250-pound bench press for somebody that weighs 250 pounds versus it's going to be a lot better for somebody that weighs 130 pounds if they can, you know, bench that much weight.

 Another feature that I want to use is a like displaying a user's like body ranking on like a vector diagram of the human anatomy that shows the body parts. And each body parts colored in a different picture based on the rank of that particular body part or area, that be it shoulders or chest, back, biceps, triceps. Based on the ranking of that, I want to show a different color. And then, um, get a, um, you know, obviously they have a rank and progress through ranks. And, uh, there needs to be a daily streak with like a heat map calendar heat map, uh, on a user's profile.
 
 Not only do I want to gamify workouts, I also want to help individuals and myself train smarter. So there needs to be a strength score, some recovery metrics, muscle balance, weekly insights, PR tracking, and volume trends.
## Behavior Flow
An example initial workflow or initial signup process would be have the user enter their weight and their gender. And we want to go ahead and get their initial strength score. So we will go ahead and ask them for some exercises they recognize. Just give them a couple options such as barbell bench press, back squat. Pull downs and then we ask them how many reps they can do and at what weight. And then based on that, we'll give them an initial score.

## Recovery
The recovery zone will say what muscle groups need recovery, what muscle groups are recovering, and what muscle groups are ready to train. And we will use our, in gathering our logic for that, we will use peer-reviewed scientific study based on muscle fatigue and recovery to give our users the most beneficial and the most accurate of recovery metrics.

## Personal Metric Tracking
Users can also log their body weight and make a body weight update if they wish. And that needs some graphs to track that over time and some statistics of highest body weight, lowest average, what the weekly change is, starting a workout. You should be able to add an exercise and there should be a search bar for searching exercises by their names. And they could be grouped by shoulder, back, chest, biceps, triceps. You should be able to click on it, add an exercise. It should populate one set. You should be able to add reps, add pounds to the set. You can log the sets RPE and then add any sets that you wish to add. Add a rest timer and be able to configure that rest timer. And based on the continued workouts, your strength score will increase. And your body image will reflect that by changing the colors of the muscle groups. And you'll also be earning an overall rank that will increase. There also should be a gym streak. System that tracks what days that you have gone to the gym. And there should also be milestones. For things such as the 500 pound club, 1000 pound club.

## Next Steps
First, I need to go ahead and create a Kanban board with and go ahead and fill it full of some tasks to do and up and coming, all that kind of stuff. And then I guess we can go ahead and start off with our software design document and any other kind of documents that we need. We'll check with we'll ask ChatGPT for all those kind of documents. Everything in this file has been voice recorded and transcribed so it's not laid out in a perfect way. So we'll give this to ChatGPT to give it some structure and remove any filler words that just come from talking as this is all transcribed text. I'm not sure what application we can use to track all this. Maybe Linear. I think it integrates well with GitHub, and this being an open source project or at least going to be released on GitHub, we will go ahead and use that for tracking and issues, all that kind of stuff. I think we should start with the front end. As once we have the front end clear, I think it'll be easier to connect the back end logic to the front end structure.
